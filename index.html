<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I'm Sara Greer - a technology professional living in South Texas with my partner and our two dogs. I work in IT at a college, where I spend my days wrangling learning management systems, automating workflows, and making technology more accessible.</p>

<p>This site started in May 2020 when I finally snagged this domain after years of waiting. It sat mostly dormant while I figured out what to do with it. Turns out what I needed was a low-pressure space to drop links, share tech solutions, document things I've learned, and occasionally talk about gardening attempts.</p>

<p>I'm a recovering journalist who transitioned to IT, a writer who struggles with posting schedules, and someone who collects too many link repositories. So I built this site to be frictionless - I can literally email posts here from my phone. No excuses.</p>

<h2>Under the hood:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> (free!)</li>
  <li>Custom domain managed through <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a></li>
  <li>Jekyll for simplicity</li>
  <li>Email-to-post automation because friction is the enemy of actually doing things</li>
  <li>Built with help from Claude Code</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll find my notes below - a mix of tech tips, interesting links, works-in-progress, and whatever else I feel like capturing. No schedule, no pressure, just things worth remembering.</p>
